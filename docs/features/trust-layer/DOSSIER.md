# Rental Trust Layer — Feature Dossier

Self-contained handoff for re-posturing Roomivo's verification stack into a
**signed, expiring, portable proof** layer whose single job is to **stop people
acting in bad faith and scamming each other** on open classifieds (Leboncoin,
Facebook Marketplace/Groups, PAP).

Source spec: `PRD-TrustLayer-v2.md` (supersedes PROJECT-TRUST-0-OPEX v1).
Condensed working context: `CLAUDE.md — Trust Layer Project Context` (read before
every task; it sets Phase-1 scope, the OSS stack, and the legal gate).
Per [[roomivo-new-convo-per-feature]] this DOSSIER is the handoff: rules +
edge-case checklist live inside it. Each sub-feature below = its own conversation,
its own worktree ([[feedback_git_worktree]]), tested edge-case-by-edge-case before
moving on ([[roomivo-test-per-feature]]).

Status legend: 🔴 blocking · 🟠 important · 🟡 polish · ✅ done.
Verdicts: **KEEP / FIX / REPLACE / KILL / BUILD**.
Last updated: 2026-06-24. Status: **Phase 1 complete**; INTL fiscal-capacity rail + UI + solvency_verified rollup **shipped & merged** (PRs #6–#11); launch prereqs done (Gemini billing, privacy/subprocessor disclosure, logos, consent). **2026-06-24: e-sign legal gate CLEARED (§0.16) — both paths (upload + generate) green-lit.** Open/next: **e-sign + lease module (items 8/9)** = the next major feature; deposit-binding + SCI (15/16); INTL HIGH deferred to EUDI. ✅ Lawyer's **written** e-sign/lease opinion now on file (2026-06-20, Mathieu Galand — `docs/legal/2026-06-20-avis-avocat-esign-lease-galand.md`); PRD §7.6 written-blessing item closed.
- **Phase 1 complete (2026-06-13):** GLI removed; credential core; FR identity MEDIUM rail + avis cross-check; FR HIGH solvency (2D-Doc ECDSA); property control (taxe foncière, PR-8 fixed); both-sided wiring (/c/ verify page, issue-mine, QR share, anti-phishing).
- **Item 2 (Credential core) landed 2026-06-05:** `Credential` model, `app/services/credential.py` (Ed25519 sign/verify), `app/routers/credentials.py` (POST /issue, GET /{id}, GET /public-key, GET /evidence.pdf, POST /issue-mine, POST /revoke), Alembic migration `c1d2e3f4a5b6`, 23 integration tests green. Assurance guards AS-1/AS-2/AS-3 enforced at signing time.
- **DPE reclassification enforcement (§5.4 PR-1/3/4/5) landed 2026-06-10.**
- **Guarantor verification fixes (§5.3 SV-3) landed 2026-06-12** (see "Done this pass" in §5.3).
- **MRH insurance verification (§5.8 IN-1..IN-5) landed** (see "Done this pass" in §5.8).
- **Item 12 (Statelessness retrofit + Redis TTL) landed 2026-06-15:** identity, income, and guarantor (Visale/Garantme) domains flipped to verify-and-forget; two-step identity front doc now stored in Redis (10-min TTL, per-upload session token) not R2; `purge_legacy_verification_docs_task` Celery task for existing stored docs (incl. nested physical-guarantor files). See §9 item 12.
- **Item 12 admin downstream gap resolved 2026-06-16:** dead `pending_review` queue and stale `VerificationReview` fields (`file_url`, `extracted_data`, always blank post-retrofit) replaced with a stranded-upload monitor — `identity_stalled` queue (users stuck >15 min at `document_uploaded`) + `POST /reset` to unblock; evidence-free identity `/approve` guarded off (400, points to `/reset`). See §9 item 12.
- **ADEME PENDING retry (PR-6) + zone tendue advisory (PR-7) landed 2026-06-13.**
- **Planning session 2026-06-17 — back-to-school roadmap set (nothing built this pass):** added decisions §0.12–0.18 (INTL student solvency = funds-not-income; rejected AIS + visa-based; plain-language assurance; Gemini-paid not NVIDIA; funds-boundary reaffirmed; e-sign legal gate **lifted**; "safer & provable" evidence positioning; SIRET nuance). New §9 paths 13–16: INTL fiscal-capacity funds rail (spec'd+planned), INTL solvency UI tab, deposit-binding evidence layer (IBAN + Verification of Payee), entity/SCI landlord verification (SIRENE/INPI). Build order in §9. Findings: **FranceConnect was never built — nothing to hide**; **EU AI Act check (§0.19) — most likely not high-risk by design, with a bright line: never become a solvency *scorer*, never 1:many biometrics, never auto-gate access.**

## 0. Decisions on record (set by product owner, 2026-06-05)

1. **North star = anti-scam, not statelessness.** Statelessness/GDPR/OPEX are
   benefits, not the goal. When they conflict with catching scammers, the
   anti-scam outcome wins. → We adopt a **hybrid architecture** (§3), not a
   big-bang stateless rewrite.
2. **GLI: remove completely.** All quote/apply code is deleted, not flagged-off.
   The PRD's insurance posture is *verification-only* and GLI distribution needs
   ORIAS + IDD (§7.3, §9). See §8 for the removal plan.
3. **Start with the dossier only.** This document. No implementation in this pass.
4. **Phase 1 = BOTH sides verified** (product-owner override of CLAUDE.md's
   tenant-only slice, 2026-06-05). Each side vets the other and leaves with a
   watermarked evidence document (§12.1):
   - **Tenant:** FR identity (France Identité *justificatif* → verify sig) + solvency
     (*avis* 2D-Doc → betagouv/2ddoc-parser → verify ECDSA → banded ratio).
   - **Landlord + property:** FR identity (same rail) + **property ownership/control**
     (ADEME DPE class lookup + *taxe foncière* document check → "control, not
     ownership-attested"). This is what directly attacks **deposit theft** (tenant
     confirms a real landlord/property before paying).
   - Combine + sign + TTL; shareable, verifiable credential per side.
   **Still excluded from Phase 1:** lease generation, e-sign, insurance (lease/e-sign
   also behind the §7.1 legal gate). ⚠ Bigger/slower than CLAUDE.md's cheapest-slice
   plan — accepted trade for delivering the deposit-theft use case. **`CLAUDE.md`
   Phase-1 section now disagrees with this and should be reconciled (see note below).**
   This **overrides the §9 ordering** for what ships first.
5. **Legal gate (hard):** do NOT build lease-generation or e-sign past a French
   *droit immobilier* lawyer blessing the self-service framing (loi 1971 / Hoguet
   gray zone). Cheap and gating. See §7.1.
6. **GTM is B2B2C-first** — pitch the verified-dossier API to a GLI insurer /
   property manager (quantifiable ROI, has budget) before the consumer badge.
   Note: selling verified facts **to** a GLI insurer ≠ Roomivo selling insurance —
   consistent with the GLI-distribution removal in §8.
7. **Access model (see §12):** access is tiered by *action*, not by who the user is.
   **Verifying** a credential is always public/accountless. **Generating** one uses
   a **passwordless email/phone magic-link** "verification identity" (not a full
   Roomivo signup) — Roomivo users get it inline; classified users get the
   passwordless lane (= the acquisition funnel).
8. **Credential resolution (see §12):** **thin server store** — persist only the
   **banded** credential record (no source docs) keyed by `credential_id`. Enables
   per-verification metering, B2B2C billing, revocation, and the evidence pack;
   signature stays independently verifiable against the public key. GDPR-light.
9. **Deliverable = watermarked, evidence-grade document** (see §12.1). External
   users visit, get their job done, and leave with a **watermarked, signed,
   timestamped, hash-anchored** document admissible as evidence — the target
   scenario is **deposit theft** (landlord collects deposit, disappears). Build
   "leave no room for scam." The evidence pack is Phase-1-central, not a later add-on.
10. **Anti-phishing trust model is a feature, not polish** (see §12.2). A link/QR in
    a Leboncoin chat looks like phishing → adoption dies unless we defeat that fear.
    Counter with: one canonical official domain, **verify-by-ID** ("don't trust the
    link — type the code on roomivo.app yourself"), published public key, and
    landing-page institutional endorsement: **PÉPITE Pays de la Loire / SNEE /
    Ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche** with logos.
    ✅ **Logo rights secured (2026-06-07):** statuses ("Lauréat PÉPITE",
    "Étudiant-Entrepreneur / SNEE") **and** the ministry/PÉPITE logos are **authorized
    for display**. See [[roomivo-legal-status-snee]].
11. **Scoping (assumption — confirm):** Phase 1 / Direction A = **(a) Roomivo-scoped
    broadcastable** credential. Direction B (Phase 2) = **(b) recipient-scoped**.

### Decisions added 2026-06-17 (this session)

12. **INTL student solvency = funds, not income.** Students have no salary/avis →
    measure *available funds*, banded as "covers ≥ N months of rent." **Rejected:**
    Open Banking AIS (needs a commercial aggregator or AISP licence — violates
    "no commercial intermediary in the data path") and **visa/titre-de-séjour as a
    solvency signal** (floor-only, stale, and nationality-coupled → Code pénal
    225-1/225-2 discrimination + breaks "same tiers for everyone"). **Deferred gold
    standard:** EUDI Wallet verifiable credential, offline-verified like the avis
    2D-Doc. Self-contained document rail ships now (item 13).
13. **Plain-language assurance to consumers.** Raw `HIGH`/`MEDIUM`/`UNVERIFIED` tier
    words create landlord friction (amber "MEDIUM" badge reads as a defect; almost
    everyone is MEDIUM today). Tiers stay in the credential JSON + B2B API (insurers
    price on them); **consumer surfaces render affirmative sentences** ("ID checked +
    selfie match"). Never collapse to a bare "Verified ✓" (rebuilds the fake-badge
    problem). See item 13 spec.
14. **Extraction stays on Gemini (paid), not NVIDIA.** The `GEMINI_DAILY_LIMIT: 1500`
    is the *free* tier — fix the quota by enabling billing, not by migrating. NVIDIA
    NIM free tier is ~40 RPM (also capped), needs a full `_ai_extract_*` rewrite +
    accuracy re-validation, and is the *same* GDPR posture (US subprocessor). NVIDIA
    kept only as a possible future fallback or self-hosted-NIM (GDPR) play.
15. **Funds boundary reaffirmed (hard).** Roomivo **never** touches/holds/escrows/routes
    the deposit or rent — that triggers payment-services + Hoguet *maniement de fonds*.
    Deposit and rent flow **directly tenant→landlord, off-platform** (their own
    neobank/transfer). Roomivo verifies the parties and records the agreed terms only.
16. **E-sign legal gate CLEARED 2026-06-24.** Lawyer green-lit **both** paths:
    (a) landlord-uploaded lease → e-sign, **and** (b) Roomivo-generated lease by
    contract type → e-sign. ✅ **Written opinion now on file (2026-06-20, Mathieu Galand,
    Avocat au Barreau de Paris)** — `docs/legal/2026-06-20-avis-avocat-esign-lease-galand.md`;
    closes the PRD §7.6 "obtain the blessing in writing" item. The opinion deems both modules
    permissible and "suitable for commercial deployment," **subject to** §3 conditions (mandatory
    provisions; annexes/diagnostics; identity verification; auditable signing record; GDPR) — the
    first two are **gating for Path A**, already met by Path B. Build order:
    **Path B** (upload + e-sign, lower risk) before **Path A** (Décret 2015-587 template
    generation). Constraints unchanged (and survive the green light): official model
    wording only (no custom clauses, loi 1971), DocuSeal/Documenso unmodified +
    self-hosted (AGPL), no success fee, never touch the deposit/funds. eIDAS simple/
    advanced signature is valid for a bail. Now the next major feature.
17. **Evidence positioning = "safer & provable," not "safe."** The evidence doc proves
    *who* + *agreed terms* + *when* (tamper-evident), **not** that money moved (the
    tenant's bank receipt does that — Roomivo isn't in the flow). "Court-admissible"
    framing must be lawyer-blessed and not overpromise an outcome; MEDIUM identity is a
    strong lead, not bulletproof ID. Binding the verified parties to a *specific*
    deposit transaction (item 15) is what turns the generic credential into a
    deposit-dispute artifact.
18. **SIRET nuance.** Free MEDIUM beta needs **no SIRET**; *charging* needs a quick
    micro-entreprise SIRET (days, free); FranceConnect's heavy SIRET + DataPass +
    4-governance-roles incorporation stays deferred. Tribee.fr = love-money funding
    only — **not** evidence of willingness-to-pay; don't present a cagnotte as
    commercial traction.
19. **EU AI Act classification (checked 2026-06-17 — orientation; lawyer to confirm
    via a classification memo on the same engagement as the e-sign blessing).**
    Current build is **most likely NOT high-risk**, *by design*:
    - **Biometric:** the selfie↔ID match is **1:1 biometric *verification*** (confirm
      the person is who they claim) → carved out of the high-risk biometric category.
    - **Solvency:** the AI only **extracts** figures from documents; **banding is a
      transparent deterministic rule, not an AI credit score**, and the human
      (landlord) decides → outside Annex III "creditworthiness evaluation."
    **🔴 Bright line — never cross (any one flips you to Annex III high-risk):**
    (1) no ML model that *scores/predicts* solvency or risk — keep AI = extractor,
    banding = fixed rule; (2) no **1:many** biometric identification — 1:1 only;
    (3) never **auto-gate** housing access — Roomivo states facts, the human decides.
    **Now:** limited-risk **transparency** applies — users must be told they're subject
    to automated AI processing (covered by the privacy AI-subprocessor disclosure;
    add an upload-step notice). Google carries the GPAI *provider* obligations; Roomivo
    is a *deployer*. High-risk Annex III obligations deferred to **2 Dec 2027**
    (Digital Omnibus, 7 May 2026) — runway, but architect to stay out, don't lean on it.
    Separate from GDPR data-residency (the Gemini→Vertex-EU question, §9 build notes).

## 1. What this product IS / IS NOT (load-bearing legal boundaries)

A self-service **verification + document utility** used *alongside* a listing the
parties already found elsewhere. It does four jobs: verify identity, verify
solvency/property, handle the lease (generate from official model OR legality-check
an uploaded one), and e-sign + emit a proof.

**The boundaries below are not style — each is the edge of a regulated activity.
Crossing one pulls Roomivo into a licensing regime.** Every feature must be checked
against this table before merge:

| Roomivo must NEVER… | …because it triggers |
|---|---|
| Search / match / recommend counterparties | Loi Hoguet (*entremise* — carte pro) |
| Hold a mandate / act on a party's behalf | Loi Hoguet (mandat) |
| Touch / hold / initiate / gate funds | Loi Hoguet *maniement de fonds* + payment-services |
| Take a success/commission fee on a signed lease | Loi Hoguet intermediation criterion |
| Draft custom lease wording *for* the parties | Loi du 31 déc. 1971 (rédaction d'actes) |
| Sell / propose / earn commission on insurance | ORIAS + IDD ← **this is why GLI is removed** |
| Guarantee rent / make a party whole | Unlicensed insurance/guarantor |
| Route / price / gate by nationality or immigration status | Code pénal 225-1/225-2 (discrimination) |
| Store identity/financial docs at rest **without need** | Avoidable GDPR liability |

**Legal thesis:** parties met on the classified → no *entremise* → this is a
verification SaaS + signed-PDF tool. Revenue is **flat / per-verification, never
success-based**. Funds never flow. Insurance is verification-only (no ORIAS).

---

## 2. The credential (the new core output)

A short-lived, **signed** JSON attestation. Roomivo holds the signing key; any
counterparty verifies the signature against the public key. This is the portable
anti-scam artifact: a wary landlord/tenant on Leboncoin can check it without an
account.

```json
{
  "credential_id": "vc_8f3a...",
  "subject_role": "tenant",              // tenant | landlord | property
  "issued_at": "2026-06-03T10:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-07-03T10:00:00Z",  // short TTL by design
  "rail": "FR",                          // FR | INTL — by DOCUMENTS held, not nationality
  "claims": {
    "identity_verified": true,
    "identity_assurance": "HIGH",        // HIGH | MEDIUM — never silently upgraded
    "identity_source": "france_identite_justificatif",
    "solvency_ratio": ">=3.0",           // BANDED, never raw figures
    "solvency_assurance": "HIGH"
  },
  "disclaimer": "Certifies verification of the stated facts only. Does not warrant future conduct or good faith.",
  "signature": "..."
}
```

Design rules (non-negotiable):
- **Bands, not raw numbers** (`ratio >= 3.0`, never the RFR). Data minimisation.
- **Assurance labelled, never inflated.** A MEDIUM check is never shown as HIGH.
- **Recipient-scoping** where the source supports it (France Identité *justificatif*
  names the recipient).

### Trust tiers
- **HIGH** — state cryptographic signature or passport chip (France Identité MoI
  sig; DGFiP-signed 2D-Doc; ICAO chip via BAC/PACE). Forgery-resistant.
- **MEDIUM** — OCR + liveness, or unsigned foreign docs. Catches casual fraud /
  typos; **does not defeat a competent forgery.** Always shown as MEDIUM.
- **UNVERIFIED** — document attached but not validated.

---

## 3. Architecture decision — hybrid, anti-scam-first

> The most powerful anti-scam levers, in order: (1) **HIGH-assurance identity**
> (state-verified, defeats forgery), (2) **property/listing verification** (kills
> ghost-listing & deposit-theft scams — the #1 Leboncoin fraud), (3) **portable
> signed proof** the wary side can actually check. Statelessness is a distant 4th.
> So we build 1–3 first; we adopt statelessness *where it removes liability without
> weakening anti-scam* (notably: keep an **evidence pack** for disputes, §6, which
> a purely stateless design would throw away).

Chosen shape:
- **BUILD** a `Credential` as a new first-class output beside existing flows.
- **New rails are stateless from day one** (France Identité, 2D-Doc, INTL, DPE):
  verify → emit credential → discard source. No new at-rest PII.
- **Legacy OCR flows keep storing** for now (they already do, to R2) — they become
  the **MEDIUM** tier and are migrated to verify-and-forget per-domain, last.
- **Assurance labelling is retrofitted first** (§5.2) — cheapest, highest integrity
  gain: today the OCR+selfie path is silently treated as fully verified, which by
  the PRD's own definition is MEDIUM. Stop the silent MEDIUM→HIGH inflation.

### Current vs target (the gap)
| Dimension | Target (PRD) | Roomivo today |
|---|---|---|
| Output | Signed, expiring, portable credential | Mutable `User.identity_data` JSON + `trust_score` int |
| Identity HIGH | France Identité / NFC chip | AI OCR + selfie face-match = **MEDIUM** |
| Solvency HIGH | DGFiP 2D-Doc signed payload / SVAIR | AI OCR of payslips = **MEDIUM** |
| Assurance | Explicit per-claim band | Booleans + one opaque `trust_score` |
| Property | ADEME DPE + "control, not ownership" | Claims `ownership_verified=True` (overclaim) |
| Insurance | Verify-only, no ORIAS | **GLI quote+apply present → REMOVE (§8)** |
| Docs | Discard new rails; migrate legacy | All kept on R2 |

Affected surface:
`backend/app/routers/{verification,leases}.py`,
`backend/app/services/{identity,identity_service,employment,lease_generator,lease_templates,cross_verification,french_government_api,gli,storage}.py`,
`frontend/app/verify/*`, `/verification`, `/verify-capture/[code]`,
`components/{VerificationUpload,VerificationGate}.tsx`.

---

## 4. The two rails (split by DOCUMENTS held, never by nationality)

This split is what keeps us clear of discrimination law (art. 225-1/2). The *same
tiers are offered to everyone*; the user self-selects on documents available.
Immigration status is **never** a gate.

| Step | FR rail | INTL rail |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | OCR+liveness (**MEDIUM**); *avis* 2D-Doc name corroboration (flag only, stays MEDIUM); HIGH deferred to FranceConnect | NFC passport chip / BAC-PACE (HIGH) → web MRZ-OCR+liveness (MEDIUM) |
| Solvency | *Avis* 2D-Doc + optional SVAIR (HIGH) | Foreign tax/payslips (MEDIUM) + currency normalisation |
| Property | ADEME DPE + document-verified control | same |
| Lease | Generated (Décret 2015-587) or uploaded-and-checked | same; foreign-law uploads "not legality-verified" |
| Insurance | French MRH attestation verify (required) | French MRH still required for FR property |
| Signature | Simple/AES + audit trail | same |

---

## 5. Edge-case & test matrix (the QA harness)

Status = coverage in Roomivo **today**. ✅ covered · 🟡 partial · ❌ missing.
"Block" = stop with a labelled error. "Flag" = proceed at lower assurance.
Tests follow the existing convention in `backend/tests_integration/` (real DB,
`make_user`/`auth` helpers, mocked AI/storage). Each row = at least one test.

### 5.1 Identity (PRD §6.1) — service: `identity.py`, `identity_service.py`

> **Update 2026-06-06:** ID-1/ID-2/ID-3 assumed a `valider-attest` API that does not exist
> (human portal only). FR HIGH identity is deferred to FranceConnect (post-incorporation).
> The shipped FR rail is MEDIUM (OCR+selfie) + *avis* 2D-Doc name corroboration. See
> `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-06-fr-identity-medium-rail-design.md`.

| # | Edge case | Expected | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| ID-1 | Altered/screenshotted *justificatif* | endpoint/sig fails → **block**, regenerate | ❌ deferred (FranceConnect path) |
| ID-2 | *Justificatif* for a different recipient | recipient mismatch → **block** | ❌ deferred |
| ID-3 | Expired single-use *justificatif* (TTL) | **block**, regenerate | ❌ deferred |
| ID-4 | No new-CNI / no NFC phone | **fallback → MEDIUM**, labelled | ✅ labelled (AS-1 fix) |
| ID-5 | Web NFC cannot read passport (impossible) | auto web-MEDIUM, never claim HIGH | ✅ `assurance` hard-coded `"MEDIUM"` in `extract_mrz`; `_FAILED_RESULT` also MEDIUM — no code path emits HIGH |
| ID-6 | MRZ checksum (mod-10) fails | transcription error → **re-scan** | ✅ `_validate_checksums` in `mrz.py`; AI pass 1 → Tesseract pass 2 → 422 `MRZ_CHECKSUM_FAIL` (bilingual) if both fail |
| ID-7 | Passport without chip (older book) | MEDIUM only, labelled | ✅ MRZ parsed normally → `identity_assurance: "MEDIUM"`; chip presence irrelevant on web path |
| ID-8 | Liveness spoof (photo-of-photo / replay) | liveness **reject**; residual noted in MEDIUM | 🟡 AI face-match rejects obvious spoofs; true replay detection not possible with OSS web path — pre-existing gap, not regressed |
| ID-9 | Non-Latin / transliterated names | MRZ transliteration tolerance, surface both forms | ✅ `name_transliteration_mismatch: true` when `full_name` non-ASCII + fuzzy-match < 0.6; MEDIUM still granted — never blocks (ID-9) |
| ID-10 | Signer ≠ verified credential subject | **block** at e-sign | ❌ |

### 5.2 Assurance labelling (PRD §2.2/§4) — retrofit, do FIRST
| # | Edge case | Expected | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| AS-1 | OCR+selfie identity result | labelled **MEDIUM**, never `HIGH` | ✅ `_validate_claims` rejects HIGH from MEDIUM-only sources; 23 integration tests cover this |
| AS-2 | OCR payslip/avis solvency | labelled **MEDIUM** | ✅ solvency_assurance validated against allowed set |
| AS-3 | Credential never upgrades band silently | assertion test: HIGH only from HIGH source | ✅ enforced pre-signing in `credential.py`; solvency_ratio must be banded string |
| AS-4 | UNVERIFIED surfaced (not hidden as "pending forever") | explicit label | 🟡 |

### 5.3 Solvency (PRD §6.2) — service: `employment.py`, `french_government_api.py`
| # | Edge case | Expected | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| SV-1 | *Avis* printed text edited, 2D-Doc intact | read **signed payload** → tampering moot | ✅ `fr_2ddoc.parse_and_verify_avis()` reads ECDSA-signed payload; printed text ignored |
| SV-2 | Authentic but superseded *avis* | **SVAIR** recency check, else flag "recency unconfirmed" | 🟡 `is_avis_stale()` flags if `annee_des_revenus` > 2 yrs old; `recency_flag` stored; SVAIR deferred |
| SV-3 | Dependant on parent's *avis* (rattaché) | guarantor path (parent verifies own facts) | ✅ guarantor flows fixed (2026-06-12): dedicated cert AI extractor; `visale_id`/`garantme_ref` populated; expiry + name-match validation; physical submit endpoint; MEDIUM/DOCUMENT_SUBMITTED assurance tier |
| SV-4 | No *avis* (student/first job/new arrival) | payslips/guarantor/Visale | 🟡 |
| SV-5 | INTL foreign doc unverifiable | **MEDIUM** + currency normalisation | ✅ `POST /intl/solvency`; `decret_2015_1437_disclaimer: true` stored; MEDIUM assurance |
| SV-6 | FX volatility over lease term | flat labelled margin (+5%, as margin not σ) | ✅ `_MARGIN = 0.05`, `fx_margin_label = "currency volatility buffer"` in `fx_normalise.py`; never varies by currency |
| SV-7 | Income just under threshold after margin | surface band honestly, **don't silently pass** | ✅ `band_solvency_ratio()` — post-margin figure banded; 2.97 → `">=2.0"` not `">=3.0"` (unit-tested) |
| SV-8a | Foreign doc shows annual figure | ÷12 or flag unclear | ✅ `normalise_income_to_monthly()` — annual ÷12; unknown → no division + `income_period_unclear: true` (conservative) |
| SV-8 | RFR mislabelled as monthly net income | present as **fiscal capacity**, not RFR/12 | ❌ audit all copy |

**Done this pass — Guarantor verification fixes (Phase 2 item 11, 2026-06-12)** —
spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-12-guarantor-verification-design.md`,
plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-12-guarantor-verification.md`.
- Fixed G-3 (critical): Visale/Garantme certs no longer routed through the employment
  AI verifier. New `employment_service.extract_guarantor_cert()` method uses a dedicated
  AI prompt to extract `cert_id`, `guaranteed_amount`, `validity_date`, `tenant_name`.
- Fixed G-2 (critical): `visale_id` / `garantme_ref` User columns now populated from the
  extracted `cert_id` after successful verification.
- Fixed G-4 (important): certificate expiry check at verify time — expired certs → 422
  with bilingual error (`CERT_EXPIRED`); boundary: cert expiring today is not expired.
- Fixed G-5 (important): `guarantor_assurance` field added to `VerificationStatusResponse`
  and status handler; values: `"MEDIUM"` (OCR-verified Visale/Garantme), `"DOCUMENT_SUBMITTED"`
  (physical docs on file). Surfaced in both the verify page and verification dashboard.
- Fixed G-1 (critical): physical guarantor submit button now calls new endpoint
  `POST /verification/guarantor/physical/submit` with `{consent: bool}`; validates all 4 docs
  present + consent; transitions to `"submitted"` status. Previously silently called `checkAuth()`
  only and left status at `"pending"` forever.
- New pure service `app/services/guarantor_compliance.py` (`assess_guarantor_cert`): fuzzy
  name match, expiry, missing-field warnings (CERT_EXPIRED/NAME_MISMATCH → error; CERT_ID_NOT_EXTRACTED/
  AMOUNT_NOT_EXTRACTED → info). 9 unit tests + 10 integration tests. 115 backend tests pass.
- **Legal grounding:** Visale/Garantme verification is document-checking, not insurance distribution
  (no ORIAS/IDD required); physical guarantor dossier collection is permissible under loi 89-462
  art. 22-2 (ALUR) with explicit third-party GDPR consent. See spec §Legal basis.
- Out of scope: Visale/Garantme direct API integration; admin review workflow for physical;
  guarantor's own identity verification (HIGH assurance path).

**Done this pass — FR identity MEDIUM rail (Phase 1 item 3)** —
spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-06-fr-identity-medium-rail-design.md`,
plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-06-fr-identity-medium-rail.md`.
- Python 3.13 upgrade; `asyncpg>=0.30.0`, `psycopg2-binary==2.9.10`, passlib crypt-removal verified.
- New `app/services/identity_assurance.py`: `OCR_LIVENESS_LABEL` + `derive_identity_assurance()` — single source of truth; inference-on-read for legacy users.
- `verification.py` — all three OCR+selfie branches stamp `identity_assurance: MEDIUM, identity_source: ocr_liveness`; `/verification/status` surfaces `identity_assurance` field.
- New `app/services/fr_2ddoc.py`: DataMatrix decode (`pylibdmtx`), PDF rasterize (`PyMuPDF`), `parse_and_verify_avis()` against ANTS TSL (ECDSA offline), `AvisParsed` dataclass.
- New endpoint `POST /verification/identity/avis-cross-check`: corroborates OCR'd ID name against DGFiP-signed declarant; assurance stays MEDIUM; avis discarded after processing (GDPR transient).
- DOSSIER + CLAUDE.md reconciled: `valider-attest` = human portal, not API; FranceConnect recorded as deferred HIGH path.
- 6 name-matching unit tests + 7 endpoint integration tests (C-1..C-8) + AS-1/AS-4 integration tests green.

**Done this pass — FR HIGH solvency rail (Phase 1 item 4)** —
spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-06-fr-identity-medium-rail-design.md` (2D-Doc pipeline reused).
- `fr_2ddoc.py` extended: `band_solvency_ratio(rfr, monthly_rent)` → banded string (`>=3.0`/`>=2.5`/`>=2.0`/`<2.0`); `is_avis_stale(annee_des_revenus)` recency flag.
- New endpoint `POST /verification/solvency/avis`: decode → parse → verify ECDSA → read `revenu_fiscal_de_reference` from signed payload → band → emit `solvency_ratio` claim (HIGH assurance). Never stores RFR.
- `recency_flag` stored in `solvency_data` when avis income year > 2 yrs old (SVAIR deferred).
- Banded ratio wired into `POST /credentials/issue-mine` as `solvency_ratio` claim.

### 5.4 Property (PRD §6.3) — NEW module + `verification.py` property upload
| # | Edge case | Expected | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| PR-1 | DPE class **G** | **warn + require acknowledgment** at publish, *not* hard-block (décence bites at lease formation, not advertising); keep class display mandatory (L126-33) | ✅ publish gate warns+ack, audit trail in `ownership_data` (2026-06-10) |
| PR-2 | Reference to class "H" | reject — scale is **A–G only** | ✅ rejected in `ademe_dpe` |
| PR-3 | 1 Jan 2026 DPE reform reclassification | read **live** ADEME, never hard-code class | ✅ authoritative ADEME (HIGH) class overrides self-typed at publish |
| PR-4 | DPE ID not found / invalid | `energy: UNVERIFIED`, **don't hard-block** | ✅ self-declared allowed (flagged), publish not hard-blocked |
| PR-5 | Expired DPE (>10yr / pre-Jul-2021) | require current | ✅ expired → warn + require acknowledgment at publish |
| PR-6 | ADEME 5xx / timeout | **non-blocking** "pending", background retry | ✅ `ADEMEUnavailable` → stores `PENDING`; `retry_pending_dpe_task` (Celery, 60 s countdown, 3 retries × 5 min) resolves to HIGH/UNVERIFIED |
| PR-7 | Zone tendue (encadrement loyers) | advisory flag vs loyer de référence majoré | ✅ `app/services/zone_tendue.py` dept-prefix lookup; `PropertyResponse.is_zone_tendue` computed field; publish stores `zone_tendue_advisory` in `ownership_data` when in zone and no `loyer_reference_majore` set |
| PR-8 | Lister ≠ owner (ghost listing) | *taxe foncière* check, label **"control, not ownership-attested"** | ✅ `POST /verification/property/control` — AI-extracts taxe foncière; stores `property_control: "documented"` / `_assurance: "MEDIUM"`; never claims ownership proved (2026-06-13) |

**Done this pass — DPE reclassification enforcement (Phase 2 item 9, 2026-06-10)** —
spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-10-dpe-reclassification-enforcement-design.md`,
plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-10-dpe-reclassification-enforcement.md`.
- New pure service `app/services/dpe_compliance.py` (`assess_dpe`): date-aware décence
  calendar (G now / F 2028 / E 2034), authoritative-class resolution (ADEME HIGH > self-typed),
  bilingual warnings. 10 unit tests.
- Publish gate (`properties.py`) rewritten: missing class → 400 (**L126-33**, the ad must
  state a class); class G / expired → **409 unless `acknowledge_dpe_warning`** (warn+ack, not
  block); authoritative ADEME class overwrites self-typed `dpe_rating` for accuracy; ack audit
  trail (`dpe_decence_acknowledged_at`/`_class`) in `ownership_data`.
- Frontend: creation wizard + edit page warn (amber notice) instead of disabling publish;
  required acknowledgment checkbox; ack UI driven by the backend **409 `warnings[]`** so
  ADEME-override / expired cases are actionable (no dead-end); legally-correct copy
  (loi Climat: class-G ban since **Jan 2025**, corrected from "2023"); FR/EN i18n parity.
- **Legal grounding:** décence énergétique bites at lease formation (ANIL), not advertising,
  so the platform warns rather than blocks; L126-33 makes the class *display* mandatory and
  requires it be accurate (hence ADEME-class-wins). Sources in the spec.
- 31 backend tests pass; frontend tsc clean.
- Out of scope / follow-up: no ADEME DPE-number capture in the wizard (kept opt-in); no
  scheduled live re-verification of existing listings.

**Done this pass — Property ownership/control (Phase 1 item 5, 2026-06-13)** —
- New endpoint `POST /verification/property/control`: accepts taxe foncière / titre de propriété upload; AI extracts landlord name + property address; fuzzy name-match against verified identity; stores `property_control: "documented"` + `property_control_assurance: "MEDIUM"` on the property. **Never claims ownership proved** — label is "control, not ownership-attested" (no free ownership oracle at €0; limit disclosed).
- PR-8 (ghost listing / deposit-theft prevention): tenant can confirm a real landlord has documented control before paying a deposit.
- Wired into `POST /credentials/issue-mine` for the landlord credential claim.
- Out of scope: official ownership lookup (Land Registry / DGFIP API) is behind incorporation.

**Done this pass — Both-sided wiring (Phase 1 item 6, 2026-06-13)** —
spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-13-both-sided-wiring.md` (if exists).
- `POST /credentials/issue-mine`: issues the caller's own credential (tenant or landlord) using their verified identity/solvency/property data; returns `credential_id` + shareable link.
- Public verify page (`/c/[credential_id]`): shows banded claims + assurance tier + validity + signature check; **no account required** (Rule 0 — §12); subject name + photo thumbnail (anti-impersonation for Direction A broadcastable).
- QR share: generates QR linking to the `/c/` verify page.
- Anti-phishing: verify-by-ID copy on the landing/verify page; institutional endorsement (PÉPITE/SNEE/Ministère) logos shown.
- Both landlord and tenant sides leave with the watermarked evidence document (§12.1) downloadable from `GET /credentials/{id}/evidence.pdf`.

### 5.5 Lease — generated (PRD §6.4) — `lease_generator.py`, `lease_templates.py`, `lease_rules.py`
**Rule-set built 2026-06-28** (`lease_rules.py`, deterministic, 21 tests, branch `feat/path-a-lease-rules`) —
the LG-1..LG-6 finalisation legality gate, **independent of lease wording**. NOT yet wired into a
generation finaliser: Path A generation itself stays **gated** on the validated Décret 2015-587 model
text + the lawyer's mandatory-provisions checklist (the existing `lease_templates.py` is custom-drafted
prose, not the official model — must be replaced/blessed before generation ships).
**Official model assets fetched (branch `feat/path-a-lease-generation`, ⏳ pending lawyer sign-off):**
verbatim Décret 2015-587 **Annexe 1 (vide)** + **Annexe 2 (meublé, serves meublé + étudiant 9-mois)**,
each with its official footnotes, version-stamped under `app/services/lease_models/2025-01-01/` and
exposed via `registry.py` (`CURRENT_TEMPLATE_VERSION="2025.01"`; a generated lease will stamp
`template_version` into the e-sign manifest). **Bail mobilité** has **no decree contrat-type** —
stored as a legal-requirement *reference* (`bail_mobilite_requirements.md`, verbatim loi 89 art.
25-12/13/14): reuses the meublé body + art. 25-13 mandatory mentions, no deposit, 1–10 mois
non-renouvelable, no solidarity clause. **Model set complete; all ⏳ pending lawyer sign-off.**
**Generator v0.1** (`lease_generation.py`, ⏳ gated): fills the tokenized fillable model
(`annexe1_vide.fill.md`) blanks with validated values, runs the LG-1..LG-6 gate first, and
refuses to finalise while any blank remains. **Safety invariant test**: the fillable's
non-blank text is byte-identical to the verbatim model → generation never alters blessed
wording (LG-6). v0.1 = `vide` core fields (10 tokens); optional "le cas échéant" sections,
meublé/mobilité fillables, PDF + e-sign wiring (stamping `template_version`) are next.
| # | Edge case | Expected | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| LG-1 | Deposit over cap for type | **block** w/ specific legal cap | ✅ `validate_deposit` (vide 1 / meublé·étudiant 2 mois HC; loi 89 art. 22) |
| LG-2 | Bail mobilité with non-zero deposit | force **0** | ✅ `validate_deposit` blocks any deposit > 0 (loi ELAN art. 25-12); `max_deposit`→0 to clamp |
| LG-3 | Furnished: Décret 2015-981 **11-item** list incomplete | **block** until all 11 confirmed | ✅ `validate_furnished_inventory` (11 categories, lists missing) |
| LG-4 | Missing mandatory annex (DPE/ERP/diagnostics/notice) | **block** finalisation; auto-stitch notice | 🟡 `validate_annexes` blocks on missing DPE/ERP/notice; auto-stitch + property-specific diagnostics deferred to the generator |
| LG-5 | Zone tendue / complément de loyer | carry advisory flag into lease | ✅ `zone_tendue_advisory` (advisory, never blocks) |
| LG-6 | Only Décret 2015-587 model wording (no custom) | enforce — avoids loi 1971 | ✅ `reject_custom_wording` blocks any custom-clause input |

### 5.6 Lease — uploaded & legality-checked (PRD §6.5) — **all NEW**
Two acceptance tiers: **VALIDATED** (passed red-line) vs **ATTACHED / NOT
LEGALITY-VERIFIED** (override or unanalysable). The credential records which.
| # | Edge case | Expected | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| LU-1 | Scanned PDF, no text layer | OCR; low confidence → **ATTACHED** + notice | ✅ `lease_legality`: no text layer (<200 chars) → ATTACHED + `LU1_no_text_layer` (PyMuPDF text extract, no OCR yet) |
| LU-2 | Clause *réputée non écrite* (loi 89-462 art. 4) | **flag** + one-click swap to template; keep → ATTACHED | 🟡 conservative high-precision patterns (salaire/pénalité/renonciation/quittance) flag → ATTACHED; no template swap (Path A) yet |
| LU-3 | Deposit/rent over cap | flag + override → ATTACHED | ❌ deferred — needs reliable amount extraction (AI); deterministic text parse too noisy. `french_compliance` caps ready to reuse |
| LU-4 | Missing mandatory annex | flag + offer to attach | ✅ DPE/ERP/notice referenced-check → flag if missing (no auto-attach yet) |
| LU-5 | Foreign-law lease | **never VALIDATED** → ATTACHED | ✅ FR-law anchor absent OR foreign governing-law signal → ATTACHED |
| LU-6 | Landlord insists on non-compliant lease | allowed; **record flags-shown-and-overridden** (liability) | ✅ never blocks; flags shown in `EsignManager` (amber) + recorded in the signed manifest (`legality_status`/`legality_flags`) |

### 5.7 E-signature (PRD §6.6) — `leases.py`, lease signature columns
French residential lease = *acte sous seing privé* → **no qualified sig required.**
Self-hosted audit trail (doc hash, timestamp, signer's credential ref, IP, consent).
| # | Edge case | Expected | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| SG-1 | Signer ≠ verified party | **block** (matches ID-10) | ✅ `esign.can_sign` + router 403 |
| SG-2 | One party abandons | session expires, **no lease**, nothing stored | ✅ manifest emitted only when both parties signed (`is_fully_signed`) |
| SG-3 | Document altered after signing | hash mismatch → sig invalid, surfaced | ✅ SHA-256 pinned at upload; re-checked at every sign + in `verify_manifest` |
| SG-4 | Repudiation / dispute | produce **evidence pack** (§6), label AES vs QTSP | ✅ `export_signature_evidence_pdf` (labelled simple/AES eIDAS, not QTSP) |
| SG-5 | Party wants max robustness | offer **QTSP** upgrade (paid, v2) | ⏸ deferred (DocuSeal/QTSP) by design |

**Done this pass — E-sign Path B v1 (Phase 2 item 8/9, 2026-06-24, branch `feat/esign-path-b`)** —
spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-24-esign-path-b-design.md`.
- **Engine decision: in-house Ed25519, not DocuSeal/Documenso** (founder constraint: 0 opex/capex —
  no second service to host, no AGPL surface). Reuses the credential signing key via new
  `CredentialService.sign_payload`/`verify_payload`, so the **published public key verifies both
  credentials and lease signatures**. DocuSeal/QTSP stay the deferred SG-5 v2 upgrade.
- Flow: landlord uploads **their own** lease PDF (Roomivo authors no wording → loi 1971 clear) →
  both **verified** parties e-sign → Ed25519-signed manifest + watermarked evidence pack.
- New `app/services/esign.py` (pure, unit-tested): `compute_document_hash` (SG-3 anchor),
  `can_sign` (SG-1), `is_fully_signed` (SG-2), `build/sign/verify_manifest`,
  `export_signature_evidence_pdf` (SG-4).
- New `app/routers/esign.py`: `POST /esign/leases/{id}/document` (landlord, identity-verified),
  `POST /esign/leases/{id}/sign` (party; SG-1/SG-3/consent), `GET …/status`, `GET …/evidence.pdf`.
- DB: `Lease.document_hash`, `document_source`, `esign_manifest` (migration `d184160e73e2`);
  reuses existing `signature_data`/`landlord_signature`/`tenant_signature`/`status`/`pdf_path`
  (`pdf_path` now holds the **storage key**, not a raw path).
- **Uploaded PDF stored via the R2 `storage` service** (durable; local fallback in dev) — new
  `storage.download_file` reads it back for the SG-3 re-hash at sign time. No ephemeral-disk gap.
- **§5.6 legality red-line shipped** (`lease_legality.py`, deterministic): on upload, screens the
  PDF text → **VALIDATED** vs **ATTACHED**; LU-1 (no text layer), LU-2 (art. 4 prohibited-clause
  patterns, partial), LU-4 (DPE/ERP/notice referenced), LU-5 (FR-law / foreign governing law).
  Never blocks (LU-6): flags shown in the UI + recorded in the signed manifest. LU-3 (deposit/rent
  cap from text) deferred to AI extraction. 10 unit tests.
- Frontend: `EsignManager` (upload / draw-or-type sign / consent / proof download), `/leases/[id]/sign`
  page, **My leases** list, Navbar entry, FR/EN i18n; landlord post-create redirect → `/sign`.
- Notifications (best-effort, never block signing): tenant nudged on upload ("ready to sign");
  both parties notified on full signature ("proof ready"). New `NotificationType.LEASE` +
  `notify_lease_ready_to_sign`/`notify_lease_fully_signed` (in-app + preferred channels).
- 16 esign + 10 legality service tests (SG-1..SG-4, cross-key, storage round-trip, LU-1/2/4/5);
  full backend suite 270 green; frontend `tsc` clean.
- **Out of v1 / next:** LU-3 deposit-cap + AI clause extraction (§5.6); Path A template generation
  (§5.5, legally gated by the opinion's mandatory-provisions + annexes conditions); DocuSeal/QTSP.
- ✅ Lawyer's **written** e-sign/lease opinion filed (2026-06-20, Mathieu Galand) —
  `docs/legal/2026-06-20-avis-avocat-esign-lease-galand.md`; PRD §7.6 / §0.16 written-blessing item closed.

### 5.8 Insurance — verification only (PRD §6.7) — **post GLI removal**
| # | Edge case | Expected | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| IN-1 | Quote submitted (not final certificate) | **reject** — must be final cert | ✅ `mrh_doc_type == "quote"` → 400 rejected |
| IN-2 | Address/name/date mismatch | normalise (strip accents, fuzzy) + **flag**; **never build RegExp from raw DB strings** (ReDoS/injection) | ✅ fuzzy name/address cross-check; flagged but not hard-blocked (landlord decides); no raw-string RegExp |
| IN-3 | Foreign insurance, French property | **block** — French MRH required | ✅ `mrh_insurer_fr == False` → 400 rejected |
| IN-4 | Cover starts after lease start | **flag** gap; landlord decides | ✅ `mrh_cover_start` stored; caller can cross-check against lease start |
| IN-5 | Cancel-after-keys | dissolves (we gate nothing); offer paid annual re-verify | ✅ by design — no access gating; annual re-verify is future paid feature |

**Done this pass — MRH insurance verification (Phase 2 item 10)** —
- New `app/services/mrh_compliance.py`: AI-extracts `mrh_insurer`, `mrh_doc_type`, `mrh_cover_start`, `mrh_insurer_fr` flag, insured address. IN-1 (quote→reject), IN-2 (fuzzy name/address flag), IN-3 (foreign→reject), IN-4 (cover-start stored), IN-5 (no gating).
- New endpoint `POST /verification/insurance/upload`: accepts certificate upload; runs compliance check; stores non-PII result in `User.insurance_data`; never stores the policy doc.
- MRH claim surfaced in `issue-mine` assurance summary and evidence PDF.
- DB columns: `insurance_verified`, `insurance_status`, `insurance_data` on `users`.
- `mrh_insurer_fr` uses a fuzzy insurer list — not raw DB RegExp.
- Legal: MRH verification = document-checking, no ORIAS/IDD; tenant MRH is mandatory under loi 89 art. 7g.

---

## 6. Monetization (sell verified facts, never protection)
Flat / per-verification, **never** success-based.
- Per-verification micro-fee (tenant-side ID/listing check — the anti-scam wedge).
- Landlord verification / subscription (their downside ≈ 10× tenant's → pricing power).
- Risk-tiered: HIGH/chip priced above MEDIUM.
- **B2B2C API** (margin engine): GLI insurers (our solvency credential = their
  underwriting dossier), agences, and the classifieds (paid "Vérifié" badge).
- **Evidence pack** (post-incident): sell the signed audit trail to the injured
  party for their legal/insurance claim. ← reason we keep an audit trail despite
  the otherwise-stateless posture.

---

## 7. Residual legal risks — NOT engineering-closable (PRD §7.6)
Must clear French counsel **before launch**:
1. **Lease-generation + e-sign framing** vs loi 1971 / Hoguet — the one real gray
   zone. Get a *droit immobilier* lawyer to bless the self-service positioning.
2. **Transient GDPR processing** — confirm lawful basis + non-retention proof with
   DPO/counsel even though there's no store.
3. **Reliance / product liability** — selling verification invites reliance.
   Mitigate via assurance-tier labelling + ToS limiting warranty to *the
   verification act only* ("we certify facts, not good faith"). Never promise an
   outcome.
4. **Ownership fraud** — cannot be fully closed at ~€0 OPEX. Disclosed + labelled.
5. **MEDIUM international tier** — not forgery-proof; never relabelled HIGH.

---

## 8. GLI removal plan (decision: remove completely)
GLI distribution needs ORIAS + IDD; it contradicts the PRD's v1 verification-only
insurance posture. **Delete, don't flag-off.**
- 🔴 **KILL** endpoints `POST /verification/gli/quote` and `/gli/apply`
  ([verification.py:1223-1326](../../../backend/app/routers/verification.py#L1223)).
- 🔴 **KILL** `backend/app/services/gli.py` (`gli_service`, `TenantProfile`, `GLIQuoteRequest`).
- 🟠 Remove the `gli_quote` feature flag + any seed/admin references.
- 🟠 Frontend: remove `/gli` page/route and any GLI CTA in dashboards/lease flow.
- 🟠 Docs: update `docs/features/README.md` row "Guarantor / GLI / Visale" → drop GLI;
  keep Visale/Garantme (those are guarantor *verification*, not insurance sale).
- ✅ Verify: grep `gli`/`GLI` repo-wide returns only historical journal mentions;
  full test suite green after removal.
- ⚠️ Keep distinct: **MRH attestation verification** (§5.8) and **Visale/Garantme
  guarantor verification** are verification, allowed, and stay.

---

## 9. Sub-features & phasing (each = own convo + worktree + dossier section)

> **Phase 1 = both sides verified** (§0.4): tenant *and* landlord/property, each
> leaving with a watermarked evidence document. Items 1–6 below. Everything from
> item 7 is **Phase 2+**; lease/e-sign are additionally blocked by the §7.1 legal
> gate. Property is **in Phase 1** (deposit-theft prevention), reversing the earlier
> CLAUDE.md tenant-only ordering.

**Phase 1 — both-sided verified credential + evidence document** ✅ all shipped
1. ✅ **GLI removal** (§8) — GLI quote/apply endpoints + `gli.py` service deleted; ORIAS/IDD legal contradiction cleared.
2. ✅ **Credential core** (§2, 2026-06-05) — `Credential` model + `app/services/credential.py` (Ed25519 sign/verify), `app/routers/credentials.py` (`POST /issue`, `GET /{id}`, `GET /public-key`, `GET /evidence.pdf`, `POST /issue-mine`, `POST /revoke`), Alembic migration `c1d2e3f4a5b6`, 23 integration tests. Thin banded store, no source docs at rest.
3. ✅ **FR identity — MEDIUM rail** (§5.1, §5.2) — OCR+selfie labelled MEDIUM (AS-1 fix); avis 2D-Doc name cross-check (anti-fraud flag, stays MEDIUM); FranceConnect recorded as deferred HIGH path. `identity_assurance.py` + `fr_2ddoc.py` + `POST /verification/identity/avis-cross-check`.
4. ✅ **FR HIGH solvency rail** (§5.3) — `POST /verification/solvency/avis`: ECDSA-verified 2D-Doc signed payload → banded ratio (`>=3.0`/`>=2.5`/`>=2.0`/`<2.0`); RFR never stored; recency flag (`is_avis_stale`); wired into `issue-mine`.
5. ✅ **Property ownership/control** (§5.4, PR-8 fix) — `POST /verification/property/control`: taxe foncière AI-extracted; "control, not ownership-attested" label; never overclaims ownership; deposit-theft prevention.
6. ✅ **Both-sided wiring** — `POST /credentials/issue-mine`; public `/c/[credential_id]` verify page (no account required); QR share; anti-phishing verify-by-ID copy + institutional logos; watermarked evidence PDF.

**Phase 2+ (defer; lease/e-sign behind §7.1 legal gate)**
7. ✅ **DPE lettability depth** (§5.4, 2026-06-10) — class-G warn+ack publish gate; expired DPE gate; ADEME authoritative-class override; bilingual FR/EN; `dpe_compliance.py`.
8. 🟡 **Uploaded-lease + generated-lease, then e-sign** (§5.5/§5.6) — ✅ **gate CLEARED 2026-06-24: lawyer green-lit BOTH paths**. ✅ **Path B (upload + e-sign) v1 SHIPPED 2026-06-24** (branch `feat/esign-path-b`, see §5.7 "Done this pass"): landlord uploads own lease → both verified parties sign → tamper-evident evidence pack; ✅ **§5.6 legality red-line shipped** (LU-1/2/4/5/6; LU-3 deferred to AI). **Still ❌:** Path A (Décret 2015-587 template generation). ✅ **Lawyer's written opinion on file** (2026-06-20, Mathieu Galand — `docs/legal/2026-06-20-avis-avocat-esign-lease-galand.md`); deems both modules deployable **subject to** §3 conditions (mandatory provisions + annexes are **gating for Path A**). Constraints unchanged: official model wording only (no custom clauses, loi 1971); no success fee; never touch the deposit/funds.
9. 🟡 **E-sign + evidence pack** (§5.7, §6) — ✅ **SHIPPED 2026-06-24 as in-house Ed25519** (NOT DocuSeal/Documenso — founder 0 opex/capex; reuses the credential signing key so one published public key verifies both). eIDAS simple/advanced sig valid for a bail; gate CLEARED 2026-06-24 (§0.16). DocuSeal/QTSP **deferred** to the SG-5 "max robustness" v2 upgrade. SG-1..SG-4 enforced + tested (§5.7).
10. ✅ **Insurance MRH verification** (§5.8) — IN-1..IN-5 covered; `mrh_compliance.py`; `POST /verification/insurance/upload`; evidence PDF row; issue-mine assurance summary.
11. 🟡 **INTL rails** (§4) — MEDIUM rail shipped (2026-06-16): `mrz.py` hybrid AI+Tesseract+ICAO-checksum; `fx_normalise.py` Frankfurter→static-29→UNVERIFIED; 3 endpoints: `POST /verification/intl/identity/upload`, `/intl/identity/selfie`, `/intl/solvency`. HIGH (NFC chip / Passive Auth) blocked on CSCA master-list assembly **AND a native app** (Web NFC is Android-only; no iOS) → **deferred to EUDI Wallet** (§0.12), not pursued now. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-15-intl-rails-design.md`.
12. ✅ **Statelessness retrofit + Redis TTL** (2026-06-15) — identity (`selfie_with_id`, `back`, `upload-selfie`), income, and guarantor (Visale/Garantme) domains flipped to verify-and-forget. Source docs discarded immediately after claim extraction; `extracted_data`/`file_url`/`storage_key` removed from JSONB. Two-step identity flow: front doc stored in **Redis with 10-min TTL** (primary); R2 fallback only if Redis unavailable; per-upload `secrets.token_hex(8)` suffix on key for web/mobile session isolation. Doc purged **before** raising face-match failure exception (GDPR: no retention on rejection). `purge_legacy_verification_docs_task` Celery task purges existing R2 docs for current users, now including nested `files[*].storage_key` for physical-guarantor records. Physical guarantor upload (human-review flow) out of scope. 15 new tests (+ 2 Redis-path tests). Known downstream: admin panel `file_url`/`extracted_data` fields always blank post-retrofit (accepted); insurance IN-2 name match uses profile name as permanent fallback (accepted statelessness tradeoff). **Admin downstream gap resolved 2026-06-16:** dead `pending_review` queue (never set post-retrofit) and stale `VerificationReview` fields (`file_url`, `extracted_data`, always blank) replaced with a stranded-upload monitor — `identity_stalled` queue surfaces users stuck >15 min at `document_uploaded`, plus a `POST /reset` endpoint so operators can unblock them. Evidence-free `/approve` action for identity guarded off (returns 400, points to `/reset`).

**New paths surfaced 2026-06-17 (specs/plans pending — sequenced for back-to-school)**
13. ✅ **INTL fiscal-capacity (funds) solvency + plain-language assurance** — **shipped 2026-06-17** (branch `feat/intl-fiscal-capacity`). `POST /verification/intl/funds`: bank statement / scholarship / sponsorship / loan-approval → FX-normalised banded `funds_coverage` (MEDIUM, funds-not-income, self-contained, no third party). `band_funds_coverage` + `_name_present` + `_ai_extract_intl_funds` helpers; anti-fraud flags (name_present, duration_covers_lease); statelessness verified (no raw amount persisted). Sponsor funds = fiscal-capacity signal (`funds_source: sponsor`), not guarantor brokering. `issue_mine` emits `funds_coverage_*` via extracted `_build_claims_for_user`. Plain-language assurance rendering shipped on the verify page (`/c/`, dropped HIGH/MEDIUM/amber badges) + evidence PDF (`_verified_phrase`, no tier words) + funds row. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-17-intl-fiscal-capacity-solvency-design.md`; Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-intl-fiscal-capacity-solvency.md`. **Still pending: item 14 (INTL solvency/funds UI tab) — endpoint has no frontend entry point yet.**
14. ❌ **INTL solvency/funds UI tab** — the INTL identity/solvency/funds endpoints are **backend-only; no frontend**. International students can verify *identity* via the existing OCR flow (MEDIUM) but have **no UI solvency path**. This is the real "serve students" gap. Wire an INTL tab calling `/intl/solvency` + `/intl/funds` (ships with item 13's endpoint).
15. ❌ **Deposit-binding evidence layer** — today's credential proves *verification status*, not a *specific deposit transaction*. Bind verified tenant ↔ verified landlord ↔ property ↔ deposit amount ↔ **payee IBAN + name-match result** ↔ date into the signed evidence doc. Student pays via own neobank (Revolut/Wise/transfer) — Roomivo not in the money flow (§0.15). Lean on EU **Verification of Payee** at pay time; mismatch (e.g. redirect to a third-party account) = red flag. GDPR: IBAN is the landlord's data → emit-and-forget, with consent.
16. ❌ **Entity / SCI landlord verification** — the person↔IBAN name-match breaks when the lessor is an **SCI** (account + lease in the entity name, not the gérant's). Verify the entity via **free state registries** (INSEE SIRENE + INPI/RNE for the gérant), then a three-way chain: verified gérant → SCI → SCI-held IBAN → property. Match becomes entity↔entity. Model already scaffolds it (`kbis_verified`, `carte_g_verified` — the latter for the property-manager/mandataire / Hoguet carte G case). Adds a **landlord-type branch** (individual vs. entity vs. manager).

### Suggested build order (back-to-school critical path)
1. **Launch prerequisites:** funded Gemini key (§0.14); privacy policy + consent + Mentions Légales (Google subprocessor disclosure **shipped** on `feat/beta-launch-prereqs`; no-SIRET status, §0.18); wire the already-authorized PÉPITE/SNEE/Ministère logos (§0.10) into verify/landing/anti-phishing surfaces (**blocked on logo image assets**). GDPR-page "entirely in the EU" claim **softened** (same branch) to match the Gemini data flow.
   - **Roadmap — Gemini → Vertex AI (EU region):** the current AI Studio Gemini API does not guarantee EU data residency. Migrate the `_ai_extract_*` layer to **Vertex AI with an EU regional endpoint** to get genuine EU residency + an enterprise DPA, which restores the strong "EU-built" claim and clears B2B-insurer diligence. Not launch-blocking; do before scaling / insurer pitch. (Distinct from the AI-Act question, §0.19.)
2. **Item 13 + 14** — INTL funds rail + its UI (makes the loop actually serve students).
3. **Item 15 + 16** — deposit-binding + entity/SCI (the deposit-safety story).
4. **Items 8/9** — e-sign Path B fast-follow (gate now lifted, §0.16).

## 11. OSS stack & caveats (from `CLAUDE.md`)
| Component | Tool | License / note |
|---|---|---|
| FR identity | France Identité state service (consumed, not built) | Free |
| FR solvency | **betagouv/2ddoc-parser** (Python) | Govt OSS; verifies ANTS ECDSA sig |
| Datamatrix decode | ZXing + pscott/poc-d-doc (browser) | Permissive |
| INTL identity HIGH | **JMRTD** (Android) + **AndyQ/NFCPassportReader** (iOS) | LGPL / MIT; needs CSCA list |
| INTL identity MEDIUM | Tesseract (MRZ OCR) + DeepFace (face match) | liveness caveat ↓ |
| Property | ADEME DPE open-data API | Free; A–G only (no H) |
| Lease generation | **pdf-lib** | MIT |
| Uploaded-lease parse | Tesseract + rule-set | Apache |
| E-signature | **DocuSeal** / **Documenso** | **AGPL — run unmodified behind API; do NOT fork** |
| Insurance verify | Insurer API preferred; Tesseract fallback | — |

Hard caveats:
- **AGPL:** DocuSeal/Documenso are AGPL — embed/API unmodified, never fork. Need to
  modify? pick a permissive alternative.
- **CSCA master list:** Passive Auth on passport chips needs issuing-country root
  certs (via ICAO PKD). Assembling a complete/current list is the INTL-HIGH
  operational gap.
- **Liveness:** OSS anti-spoofing has materially higher false-accept than commercial
  3D — exactly why MEDIUM stays MEDIUM. Never present OSS liveness as fraud-proof.

## 12. Access & flow model (Roomivo users + classified users)

Tier access by **action**, not by who the person is. Three personas:

| Persona | Action | Account? |
|---|---|---|
| **Subject** (Roomivo or classified user) | gets verified → credential issued about them | **passwordless** magic-link anchor |
| **Verifier** (landlord/tenant on Leboncoin/FB/PAP) | *reads* a credential sent to them | **never** — public, no install |
| **Requester** (Roomivo user vetting someone) | asks a counterparty to prove themselves | already a Roomivo user |

**Rule 0:** verifying a credential MUST never require an account or app install. A
signup wall here kills the anti-scam value. Verifier opens link → banded claims +
assurance tier + validity date + "signature valid ✓" against the published public
key.

### Direction A — subject proves themselves outward (tenant wedge)
1. Tenant verifies (FR identity + solvency) → signed credential.
2. Gets shareable link / QR (`roomivo.app/c/<credential_id>`).
3. Pastes it into the Leboncoin/FB message.
4. Landlord (no account) opens the public verify page. Done.

### Direction B — Roomivo user pulls a proof inward (landlord wedge)
1. Roomivo landlord generates a **verification-request link**.
2. Sends it to the classified applicant.
3. Applicant (no account) opens it → guided verification; the France Identité
   *justificatif* is generated **naming that landlord as recipient** → replay-proof,
   scoped 1:1.
4. Landlord receives the resulting credential.

**Precedent in code:** the accountless lane already exists — the
[verify-capture/[code]](../../../frontend/app/verify-capture/[code]/page.tsx)
session + the **tokenless**
[`/identity/upload-mobile`](../../../backend/app/routers/verification.py#L331)
endpoint (session-code, no auth header). The Trust Layer generalises this into a
public credential rail.

### Decisions (recorded §0.7–0.8)
- **Generation = passwordless magic-link** verification identity (not full signup).
  Roomivo users inline; classified users via the passwordless lane = funnel.
- **Verification = always public/accountless.**
- **Resolution = thin server store** of the banded record (no source docs) +
  independently checkable signature.

### Recipient-scoping — SETTLED (direction-dependent)
- **Phase 1 / Direction A** (tenant broadcasts, recipient unknown) = **(a)
  Roomivo-scoped**: *justificatif* names "Roomivo"; any verifier trusts it via the
  signature; broadcastable. Anti-impersonation: subject **name + photo thumbnail**
  shown on the verify page (verifier matches it to the person they're chatting with),
  short TTL, revocable (thin store).
- **Direction B** (landlord requests, recipient known, Phase 2) = **(b)
  recipient-scoped**: *justificatif* names the landlord → replay-proof, 1:1.

## 12.1 Evidentiary deliverable (the watermarked evidence document)
Target scenario: **deposit-theft** — a (often ghost) landlord collects a deposit
then disappears; the victim needs court/police/insurer-grade proof. So the artifact
handed to the user is not just a screen badge — it is a **downloadable, watermarked,
signed document** containing:
- subject identity (name + photo thumbnail) and the banded claims verified;
- **assurance tier** per claim (HIGH/MEDIUM) — honestly labelled;
- **issued/expiry timestamps**, `credential_id`, and a **content hash**;
- the **cryptographic signature** + a pointer to the public key / verify-by-ID page;
- recipient (Direction B) or "Roomivo-scoped" (Direction A);
- the §2 disclaimer ("certifies facts, not good faith").

Reuse the existing [`apply_watermark`](../../../backend/app/utils/watermark.py)
util. The thin store (decision §0.8) retains the **banded record** so the user — or
a victim — can re-fetch / regenerate the evidence document until expiry, and so an
**evidence pack** (§6) can be produced post-incident. No source documents at rest.
"Leave no room for scam": short TTL, revocation, tamper-evident hash, no raw figures,
no silent tier inflation.

## 12.2 Anti-phishing & trust model (adoption-critical)
A link/QR pasted into a classified's chat is indistinguishable from phishing to a
wary user — defeating that fear is a Phase-1 requirement, not polish.
- **One canonical official domain.** Never URL shorteners or lookalike domains
  (they scream phishing). Human-readable verify URLs only.
- **Verify-by-ID pattern:** "Don't trust the link — go to roomivo.app and enter this
  code." The credential ID is checkable on the known-safe site, so a victim never has
  to trust an inbound link. Strongest anti-phishing UX.
- **Published public key** so technical / B2B verifiers check the signature themselves.
- **Institutional endorsement on the landing + verify pages:** supported by **PÉPITE
  Pays de la Loire**, under **SNEE** (Statut National Étudiant-Entrepreneur), **French
  Ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche** — with logos, to convert
  "is this a scam?" into "this is state-backed." Consistent with
  [[roomivo-legal-status-snee]] and the existing Mentions Légales.
  - ✅ **Logo rights:** affiliation *statuses* **and** the official logos (ministry /
    PÉPITE) are **authorized for display** (confirmed by founder 2026-06-07). Display them
    on the landing + verify pages to maximise the "state-backed" trust signal.
- A short **"How to know this link is real"** explainer page reinforcing the above.

*§7 items must clear legal review before launch — they are not engineering-closable.*
